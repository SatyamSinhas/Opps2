    "The `__del__` method is similar to a destructor in some other programming languages, but it's not exactly the same. The actual destruction of the object is done by the garbage collector, not the `__del__` method¹. The `__del__` method simply provides a hook that allows you to execute code right before the object is destroyed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `__del__` method is related to the constructor (`__init__` method) in the sense that they are both special methods that are invoked at key points in the lifecycle of an object - the constructor is called when the object is created, and the `__del__` method is called when the object is about to be destroyed.\n",

    "However, it's important to note that the `__del__` method is not intended for general resource cleanup¹. Since you cannot control when exactly it will be called, it's recommended to use context managers or the `finally` clause of a `try` statement for cleanup tasks². Exceptions that occur inside the `__del__` method are not raised but kept silent.\n",

    "'''Method overriding is an ability of any object-oriented programming language that allows a subclass or child class to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already provided by one of its super-classes or parent classes¹. When a method in a subclass has the same name, same parameters or signature, and same return type (or sub-type) as a method in its super-class, then the method in the subclass is said to override the method in the super-class¹.\n",
    "The version of a method that is executed will be determined by the object that is used to invoke it. If an object of a parent class is used to invoke the method, then the version in the parent class will be executed, but if an object of the subclass is used to invoke the method, then the version in the child class will be executed¹.\n",
    "Here's an example of method overriding in Python:\n",

    "'''Sure, let's discuss these two fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming:\n",
    "1. **Is-A Relationship (Inheritance)**: The \"is-a\" relationship is based on inheritance, which is a mechanism that allows one class to inherit properties from another class. This relationship is also known as an inheritance or \"is-a\" relationship because it represents a parent-child relationship between classes. For example, if you have a `Bird` class (parent) and a `Sparrow` class (child), the `Sparrow` class is a `Bird`, so there's an \"is-a\" relationship between them³.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Here's a Python example of an \"is-a\" relationship:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    class Bird:\n",
    "        def fly(self):\n",
    "            print(\"Bird is flying\")\n",

    "    s = Sparrow()\n",
    "    s.fly()  # Output: Bird is flying\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    In this example, `Sparrow` is a subclass of `Bird`, so it inherits the `fly` method from `Bird`²⁴.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Has-A Relationship (Composition)**: The \"has-a\" relationship is based on composition, which is a concept that models a relationship between two classes where one contains an instance of another¹². This relationship is also known as a composition or \"has-a\" relationship¹². For example, a `Car` class might have a `Engine` class, so there's a \"has-a\" relationship between them.\n",
    "Here's a Python example of a \"has-a\" relationship:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    class Engine:\n",
    "        def start(self):\n",
    "            print(\"Engine started\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    class Car:\n",
    "        def __init__(self):\n",
    "            self.engine = Engine()\n",
    "\n",
    "        def start_engine(self):\n",
    "            self.engine.start()\n",

    "    c = Car()\n",
    "    c.start_engine()  # Output: Engine started\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    In this example, `Car` has an instance of `Engine`, so it has a \"has-a\" relationship with `Engine`¹.\n",

It provides a way to protect data from accidental modification by hiding the implementation details of a class from outside access. This concept is used to hide the values or state of a structured data object inside a class, preventing unauthorized parties\\' direct access to them¹²³⁴.\\n\\nThe key principles of encapsulation are:\\n\\n1. **Data Hiding**: Data hiding is a concept which underlines the hiding of data or information from the user. It includes object details such as data members, internal work¹⁶. Data hiding excludes full data entry to class members and defends object integrity by preventing unintended changes¹⁶. Data hiding in Python is performed using the `__` double underscore before the attribute name. This makes the class members non-public and isolated from the other classes⁶.\\n\\n2. **Access Control**: Python provides access modifiers to control the visibility and accessibility of class attributes and methods. Although Python does not have strict access modifiers like some other languages (e.g., Java), it provides a convention to indicate the intended visibility of an attribute or method⁷. The access modifiers commonly used in Python are:\\n    - **Public (No underscore prefix)**: Public attributes and methods can be accessed from anywhere, both within and outside the class⁷.\\n    - **Protected (Single underscore prefix)**: Protected attributes and methods are intended to be accessed only from within the class and its subclasses⁷.\\n    - **Private (Double underscore prefix)**: Private attributes and methods are intended to be accessed only from within the class itself⁷.\\n\\nHere\\'s an example of encapsulation in Python:\\n\\n```python\\nclass BankAccount:\\n    def __init__(self, account_number, balance):\\n        self.__account_number = account_number\\n        self.__balance = balance\\n\\n    def get_account_number(self):\\n        return self.__account_number\\n\\n    def get_balance(self):\\n        return self.__balance\\n\\n    def deposit(self, amount):\\n        self.__balance += amount\\n\\n    def withdraw(self, amount):\\n        if self.__balance >= amount:\\n            self.__balance -= amount\\n        else:\\n            print(\"Insufficient balance!\")\\n```\\n\\nIn this example, the `BankAccount` class has two private (hidden) attributes - `__account_number` and `__balance`. These attributes can only be accessed through the public methods `get_account_number()` and `get_balance()`. Attempting to access them directly, like `bank_account.__balance`, will result in an error'"

    "'''Encapsulation is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that describes the idea of bundling data and the methods that work on data within one unit. It provides a way to protect data from accidental modification by hiding the implementation details of a class from outside access. This concept is used to hide the values or state of a structured data object inside a class, preventing unauthorized parties' direct access to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key principles of encapsulation are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Hiding**: Data hiding is a concept which underlines the hiding of data or information from the user. It includes object details such as data members, internal work¹⁶. Data hiding excludes full data entry to class members and defends object integrity by preventing unintended changes¹⁶. Data hiding in Python is performed using the `__` double underscore before the attribute name. This makes the class members non-public and isolated from the other classes⁶.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Access Control**: Python provides access modifiers to control the visibility and accessibility of class attributes and methods. Although Python does not have strict access modifiers like some other languages (e.g., Java), it provides a convention to indicate the intended visibility of an attribute or method⁷. The access modifiers commonly used in Python are:\n",
    "    - **Public (No underscore prefix)**: Public attributes and methods can be accessed from anywhere, both within and outside the class⁷.\n",
    "    - **Protected (Single underscore prefix)**: Protected attributes and methods are intended to be accessed only from within the class and its subclasses⁷.\n",
    "    - **Private (Double underscore prefix)**: Private attributes and methods are intended to be accessed only from within the class itself⁷.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of encapsulation in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class BankAccount:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, account_number, balance):\n",
    "        self.__account_number = account_number\n",
    "        self.__balance = balance\n",
    "\n",
    "    def get_account_number(self):\n",
    "        return self.__account_number\n",
    "\n",
    "    def get_balance(self):\n",
    "        return self.__balance\n",
    "\n",
    "    def deposit(self, amount):\n",
    "        self.__balance += amount\n",
    "\n",
    "    def withdraw(self, amount):\n",
    "        if self.__balance >= amount:\n",
    "            self.__balance -= amount\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            print(\"Insufficient balance!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `BankAccount` class has two private (hidden) attributes - `__account_number` and `__balance`. These attributes can only be accessed through the public methods `get_account_number()` and `get_balance()`. Attempting to access them directly, like `bank_account.__balance`, will result in an error'''"

The two main types of polymorphism are compile-time polymorphism and runtime polymorphism.\\n\\n1. **Compile-Time Polymorphism**: Also known as static or early binding, compile-time polymorphism occurs when the object is bound with its functionality at compile time. In Python, this is typically achieved through method overloading, where multiple methods in a class have the same name but different parameters¹². However, Python does not support method overloading directly.
